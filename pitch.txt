Let's not bore you with slide decks. I want to tell you a story.
I've heard Sierra Leone is a great destination at this time of the year. Oh, but I remember hearing about Ebola there.

Oh. Wow. This looks risky. Maybe I should stick to the safers parts of Sierra Leone

Yikes, this still doesn't seem too safe. Maybe I should postpone my trip by a couple of months.

This looks better. I'll book my flight tickets now.

Now, Let me don the hat of a MyLan executive.
What would be my main goal? To increase the profitibality of MyLan, of course. I want to leverage this product. What we saw till now were nothing but predictions. These predictions can be a vital aspect in coming up with my business strategies. I will appropriately decide the production volumes and supply chain management for key drugs.

So how do we do this magic? How are we different? We use historical data to capture large scale trends. 
But what are these tweets doing here?  
The architecture we have not only uses historical data. It also incorporates data from social media and we can also incorporate other trend portraying sources such as news headlines, weather reports and data from on body sensors.

Through the hack that we presented, we can save lives. This is the future.

Any questions?
